Critical Applications:  Book Recommendation System
In the era of information overload, recommendation systems have become essential tools for guiding users toward relevant choices. Online book-selling websites leverage recommendation systems as a powerful means to increase profit and retain buyers[1]. A well-designed book recommendation system must suggest books that align with the buyerâ€™s interests, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and boosting engagement.
This report presents a comprehensive book recommendation system developed using a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The system utilizes the Book-Crossing Dataset to deliver accurate, personalized book suggestions. Key aspects of the project include data preprocessing, the implementation of advanced recommendation algorithms, and the evaluation of system performance through robust metrics.
By combining state-of-the-art algorithms and data-driven insights, the project aims to optimize recommendation accuracy and improve overall user experience[1].
